            <h3>What is the perks of being a Web Developer?</h3>
            <p>
                Obviously, there are a lot of financial advantages that you get. But more important than that, you have the ability to write software that you want for yourself. For example: I was once missing the childhood days when I used to play the 16-bit car race
                game. So, I created one for myself (Used OpenGl with C++). I wrote my own Sudoku game (Java Swing) and Sudoku solver. That helped me improve my skills. My college's courier management portal wasn't very good. So, I developed a new one
                for them (too bad it wasn't deployed :/). Wrote a cron job to remind me about birthdays (it was 2008 and android wasn't there then). Wrote a small shell script in vimrc to add a small template code (#includes etc.) in every .c/.cpp file
                that I open. That saved a lot of time for me. Someone created a fake FB account of a female friend of mine. Some pretty horrible photoshopped pics were posted there. I helped her to not only delete that account but also traced who the
                person was.
